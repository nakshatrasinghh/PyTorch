PyTorch-Transformers (formerly known as pytorch-pretrained-bert) is a library of state-of-the-art pre-trained models for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The library currently contains PyTorch implementations, pre-trained model weights, usage scripts and conversion utilities for the following models:

- [GPT](https://github.com/openai/finetune-transformer-lm) (from OpenAI) released with the paper [Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training](https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised/) by Alec Radford, Karthik Narasimhan, Tim Salimans and Ilya Sutskever.
- [GPT-2](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/) (from OpenAI) released with the paper [Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners[(https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/) by Alec Radford*, Jeffrey Wu*, Rewon Child, David Luan, Dario Amodei** and Ilya Sutskever**.
